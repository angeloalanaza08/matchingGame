<h1>Matching Game</h1>
Project Based Learning Module by Fireship.com

<h3>Description</h3>
A Matching Game that will put your memory skills to test a challenging flip over cards to find matching pairs. Created using ReactJs, HTML and CSS.

<h3>Objectives</h3>
The goal of Memory Match Mania is simple: match all the pairs of cards on the game board in as few moves as possible. The game starts with a set of face-down cards arranged in a grid. Each card has a unique image or pattern hidden on its back.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
At the beginning, the cards are shuffled and placed face-down on the grid. Your task is to turn over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. To do this, click or tap on a card to flip it over and reveal the image. Then, select another card to see if it matches the first one. If the two cards match, they will remain face-up on the board. If the cards don't match, they will be flipped face-down again, and you'll need to remember their locations for future attempts. The game continues until all the pairs are successfully matched.
